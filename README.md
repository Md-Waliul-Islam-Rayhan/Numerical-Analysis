# Numerical Analysis - Python

This repository provides Python implementations of a variety of numerical analysis methods commonly used for solving mathematical problems. The code is written in Python 3 and makes use of popular libraries such as `numpy` and `matplotlib` for computational and visualization purposes.

## Contents

The repository includes Python scripts for the following numerical analysis methods:

- **Root-Finding Methods**:
  - Bisection Method
  - Newton-Raphson Method
  - Secant Method
  - Fixed Point Iteration Method
  - False Position Method

- **Interpolation Methods**:
  - Lagrange Interpolation
  - Newton's Divided Difference Interpolation
  - Newton's Forward and Backward Difference Interpolation

- **Numerical Integration**:
  - Trapezoidal Rule
  - Simpson's Rule
  - Gauss Quadrature

- **Differential Equation Solvers**:
  - Euler's Method
  - Runge-Kutta Method
  - Adams-Bashforth Method
  - Adams-Moulton Method

## Requirements

To run the code, you need Python 3 and the following libraries installed on your system:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/waliulrayhan/Numerical-Analysis-Python.git
   cd Numerical-Analysis-Python
2. Run any Python script using:
   ```bash
   python3 script_name.py
3. You can also use an online Python interpreter, such as <a href="https://replit.com/">Repl.it</a>

### Input and Output

- **Input Parameters**: Each method requires specific inputs such as functions, intervals, tolerances, initial guesses, etc.
- **Output**: The scripts provide the approximate solution, error estimation, and number of iterations. In some cases, the function and its solution are plotted for better visualization.

## Documentation

Each Python file is thoroughly commented to explain the logic and steps of the respective method. The code is designed for educational purposes and aims to help students and learners understand the fundamentals of numerical analysis. While the implementation may not be optimized for all use cases, it serves as an excellent learning tool.
